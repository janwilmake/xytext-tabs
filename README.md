demonstrates that files can be accessible with navigation and tabs on new html pages super fast. no dynamic js needed!

because of this simplicity, files are also accessible in the same way by agents (curl without accept)

TODO:

- llms.txt as source for navigation
- files are imported from github repo based on /owner/repo
- files coming from DO
- nicer, nested, navigation
- filepinning
